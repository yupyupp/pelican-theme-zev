pelican-theme-zev
=================

Theme for [pelican](http://getpelican.com) static site generator. It is heavily based on [Just Read](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes/tree/master/Just-Read).

See an example [here](https://kd8zev.net)!

## TODO
 - Add example config file
 - Add option to have static home page (as opposed to most recent posts)
 - Tweak color scheme
 - Add logo option
 - Move the templates/index.html "More posts in archive" to center of page
 - Align title with top navbar
